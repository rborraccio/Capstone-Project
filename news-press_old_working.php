	            <h2>Chrysler executive drives to the top</h2>
				<p>Rochester Eccentric<br />
				    By Annette Kingsbury<br /> 
				    Staff Writer<br /> 
				    Sunday, September 12, 2004
				</p>
				<div>
					<p>From his office on the top floor of Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Tom LaSorda has a great view of the surrounding countryside. After 27 years in the automobile industry, he also has a unique perspective of what goes into making a car.</p> 
					<p>On May 1, LaSorda, 50, of Rochester, became Chrysler Group's chief operating officer and a member of the DaimlerChrysler Board of Management. It's a long way from his childhood in Windsor, where he was one of nine children of a union leader in a Chrysler factory.</p> 
					<p>With the promotion, what had been an intentionally low-profile if highly successful career has suddenly catapulted into the spotlight, with a profile in the New York Times, his picture in Forbes magazine and frequent trips to Europe. The new job doesn't leave much time for leisure, and LaSorda laughs out loud when asked about it. He says he has a heated pool, "But I haven't had time to use it." He does enjoy golf. </p>
					<p>"He's a great golfer," said <strong>Lino Borraccio</strong>, a friend and owner of <em>Lino's restaurant</em> in Rochester Hills. "He hits the ball a long ways. My favorite thing that I always get on him is he can't putt." Borraccio said LaSorda also is a wine connoisseur with his own cellar. But despite his rank as the No. 2 man at Chrysler, he remains a regular guy. </p>
					<p>"You'd never know the position he has, he's such a nice guy," Borraccio said. "They're just absolutely wonderful people. They're very unpretentious. ... If I could be like him, that'd be great." LaSorda's father and a grandfather worked for Chrysler in Windsor. LaSorda did, too, rejecting his father's offer to remortgage the family home to pay for college.</p> 
					<p>"When you grow up in a family like that, you kind of understand what it's like when your dad is laid off," he said. "I think it just creates a different focus for you. And then when you have brothers and sisters that work in factories - some are union officials as well - it kind of gives you a perspective of what's it like from their end when some management person make a decision that costs hundreds of jobs." LaSorda earned dual bachelor's degrees in arts and commerce in 1977. The same year, he joined General Motors. He later earned a master's degree in business administration.</p> 
					<p>He and his wife, Doreen, also a Canadian, have been married for 27 years and have two daughters, ages 22 and 19. The family lived in Michigan from 1985-87, then in Germany from 1991-93. LaSorda spent 23 years with GM and also worked for a time for a Japanese automaker before joining Chrysler in 2000 as senior vice president, powertrain manufacturing. The entrepreneurial spirit emerged early on, with paper routes and other undertakings, including one during the heyday of Detroit Tigers pitcher Mark "The Bird" Fidrych when he and a friend decided to get into the T-shirt business. 
					"We brought them over to Windsor and we were selling them," he said. "My dad asked, 'Do you have a license, because you're going to be in big trouble if you don't.' He said, 'I'd recommend you take those back to where you bought them.' So we took them back."</p> 
					<p>These days, his job involves overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler. 
					"It's everything from quality to manufacturing to materials ... what brings a car to the marketplace ... once we decide what we want to build," he said. 
					The latest promotion, he said, is the product of a well-rounded career. 
					"I think everyone should be pretty proud of their history, regardless of what it is," he said. "The German background certainly helped. ... I still believe it's fundamentally how you deal with people, how you treat them and try to get them on your team."</p> 
					<p>LaSorda scoffs at the notion that having a North American positioned to once again lead Chrysler is something of a milestone. 
					"The shareholders don't care," he said. "The shareholders want the best-qualified person regardless of creed, color, sex or whatever. If they're the best to run the company, they should be the ones appointed for it. "I don't ever believe that one should look at what their next job is anyway. You've got a job that you perform, people take care of you. "If there's somebody more qualified to run the company better than me, I would welcome that person." </p>

					<p><em>‘Out of the Rubble’: Lino Borraccio’s Life Story</em></p>
					<p>The life story of Lino Borraccio, owner of Lino’s Restaurant in Rochester, came to life in the book “Out of the Rubble” From World War II Chaos to American Entrepreneur: at a book release part held Thursday May 22. The event was also a fundraiser for Rett Syndorme, since Borraccio’s granddaughter Rachel is afflicted with the syndrome.</p>

					<p>Borraccio, who was born in San Vittore del Laxio, Italy, just 20 days after Japan’s raid on Pearl Harbor, grew up in the small mountain village until the family moved to America in the late 1950s. The book chronicles his life through the early years, to joining the U.S. Army, to marrying his wife and starting a family, to opening Lino’s Restaurant in 1980, and the success that he has achieved ever since. </p>

					<p>Author and Borraccio’s personal friend, Alicia J. Winget, spent 18 months in talks with Borraccio and then transcription of her notes to craft the book. She even went to Italy with Borraccio and his family to understand what the village was like where he grew up. “I wanted to get a visual of what allied troops were up against in the battle of Monte Casino, literally carved from the mountain,” says Winget. </p>


					<p>The idea for the book sprang to life in May 2012, when WDIV personality Marc Santia dined at Lino’s and spoke with Borraccio. Santia’s family was from the same area of Italy, and he decided to do a feature story for Memorial Day weekend on Borraccio’s experiences in the Army, as well as his move from Italy to America. </p>

					<p>Twelve years later, “Out of the Rubble” was released just before Memorial Day as a tribute to that story and a continuation of Borraccio’s life adventures.

					The 130-page biography details the trials and tribulations Borraccio went throught to come to America and the success he has enjoyed here in the restaurant business. From meeting greats like Tommy Lasorda of the Dodgers, to Tom LaSorda, CEO of Chrylser, Lino’s 34-year-history is steeped in the Italian traditions of his parents and grandparents. </p>

					<p>One night, Borraccio recalls, he was at an event at the Ritz Carlton in Dearborn with 900 people. “They took us to a private room,” he says, where he met Tommy LaSorda. Those with him bragged about Borraccio’s Italian restaurant. LaSorda wanted Italian food, so later that night, at 11 pm, “with a napkin tucked in,” Borraccio prepared food for LaSorda and Tom LaSorda, CEO of Chrysler. “Tommy said, ‘I haven’t had sausage like this since I had it with Frankie in Philly,” referring to Frank Sinatra.  </p>

					<p>Along the way, Borraccio hosted a slew of other prominent guests at his restaurant, including soccer star Pele, Ted Lindsay, Gordie Howe and Bob Nardelli of Chrysler.  The book retails for $11.95. See more about the new book at Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com</p>

						<br />50 W. Tienken Rd., Rochester
						</p>
						<p>"If you like Italian food, we'll take you to Lino's," Mary and Neil Hartwig of Rochester told us as we sipped martinis in the Royal Viking Sea Lounge on an Australia-Hong Kong curise.</p>
						<p>They did and they were right -- it is an undiscovered gem of an eatery.  Owner Lino Borraccio calls its decor "Old Country Italian," with walls of dark wood displaying European lithographs, a massive brass-hooded fireplace dividing booth-lined, 125-seat dining room with terra cotta floor.  Wife Ellen noted Lino's is dimly lighted enough to be romantic, yet light enough to read menu.</p>
						<p>Bar to one side is of brass-trimmed oak, with sports lightographs.  As we sipped a Tanqueray martini $4.50 ( regular $3.25 ), we counted 11 pasta entrees spaghetti, meat balls, angel hair, tomato, basil sauce, $8.95 to linguini with red or white seafood sauce $13.95.  Eleven meat entrees ran two chicken dishes $11.25 to lamb chops $18.95.  Broiled Orange Roughy $10.95, Canadian Salmon, broiled, or with seasoned breadcrumbs $14.95.</p>
						<p>Entrees include pasta or vegetables, salad, bread.  Our crips salad was dressed with sweet-sour sauce, pine nuts, very good.  My escargot in sweet brown garlic butter sauce $5.95 was different, very good.  Other appetizers Italian sausage, peppers, onion; antipasto $4.50; roasted pepers, fontina cheese $3.50, minestrone soup $2.25.</p>
						<p>Wife Ellen's veal limoni $13.95, passed muster.  My spaghetti had a slightly sweet, rich sauce I liked.  Onion, sauasge, pepper had an unusual tomato flavor $4.50.  Serivce excellent, coffee hot, strong.  Desserts $2.95 cannoli to Zabaglione Marsala $4.25 we didn't test.</p>
						<p>From cheffing at Madison Heights Venetian Club, Lino took over this Roman Tavern three years ago. Credit cards.  Handicapped.  Non-smoking area.  Piano entertainment Fri., Sat.  Open 5-10 p.m. Mon.-Thurs., 5-11 p.m. Fri.Sat., 4-9 p.m. Sun. (313) 652-9002 -- LRB</p>

		            <h2>Business of the Week - Lino's Restaurant</h2>
					<h3>By Jane Paterson of the Oakland Press</h3>
					<div>
						<p>At any given time at Lino's Restaurant in Rochester Hills, you can smell the unmistakable aroma of authentic Italian cuisine, look around the room and see families enjoying a meal together and hear golfers fudging their golf handicaps.</p>
						<p>In a comfortable, recently remodeled dining area, your biggest problem will be deciding what to order. Your choices range from a tender Filet Mignon to a succulent lobster tail to traditional Italian pasta dishes and a full menu of other mouth-watering choices.</p>
						<p>Owned by the Borraccio family, Lino’s is well known in the Rochester area. The upscale, but unpretentious, restaurant has been in the same location for 24 year.</p>
						<p>Food is always freshly prepared. On Tuesdays you can find Tony’s mother (Elvira) and other ladies in the kitchen making gallons of sauces the old-fashioned way. Wednesday the home-made pastas are created and on other days you’ll find peppers being roasted in the oven.</p>
						<p>The perch comes fresh from Canada and is lightly dusted with flour so the fresh taste comes through without a lot of batter.</p>
						<p>Homemade lasagna, with or with meat, is a hour specially, the 16 oz. black Angus New Your strip steak melts in your mount and a 14 oz. veal chop, the chicken with Grand Mariner and seafood ravioli are culinary delights not be missed.</p>
						<p>Whether you bring in your family or host a business meal, you’ll receive great food and service every single time.</p>
						<p>“Consistency is important,” said Lino. “You can come 10 times out of 10 and have a great meal.”</p>
						<p>There’s always a family member present at the restaurant to greet customers.</p>
						<p>There’s a full-service bar so patrons can enjoy a glass of wine with their meals.</p>
						<p>A popular spot for business executives, Lino’s Restaurant also hosts functions in its banquet room that seats 90 people.</p>
						<p>“We host a lot of corporate dinner meetings, local school functions and sports banquets, memorial luncheons and holiday parties.” said Lino.</p>
						<p>The restaurant also offers catering off-site.</p>
						<p>Service is a top priority. The experienced wait staff knows how to read their customers and won’t interrupt a conversation to check on the table just because they are passing by.</p>
						<p>Patrons will find many changes to come as the Borraccio family continues to remodel the restaurant.</p>
						<p>With all the construction changing the landscape of the area around the restaurant, the Borraccio’s want patrons to know that Lino’s will be staying open and the family’s commitment to the community will remain unchanged.</p>
						<p>“We’re not going anywhere.” said Tony.</p>
						<p>Hours are 5-10 pm Monday-Thursday; 5-11 pm Friday and Saturday; and 4-9 pm Sunday.</p>

					    <p>Drive past Lino's and all you'll think is that the pretty, manicured building looks like a nice place to stop for spaghetti.</p>
					    <p>But make that first stop, and you will turn into a convert. Here, fine cuisine meets Italian grandmas. The kitchen is anchored by longtime Joe Muer executive chef Andy Toth.
					    The pastas and sauces are made fresh by the family, Lino Borraccio's mother, Rosa; his wife, Vera; Vera's mother, Angela Bettraino, and two of Bettraino's friends -- all from
					    the same area about 80 miles south of Rome.</p>
					    <p>Lino's has the look and feel of a family restaurant. Pictures of Italy are on the walls; the color scheme is dark, the booths ample, the waitresses motherly.</p>
					    <p>But the very good food makes Lino's a destination restaurant -- worth a drive from another city.</p>
					    <p>There are six kinds of veal -- tosca, marsala, limone, Milanese, parmigiana and alla guiliana (with vodka). Can't decide? There's a veal sampler -- choose three.</p>
					    <p>The house-made pastas are wonderful. Twice each week, Angela Bettraino and friends create
					    fresh ravioli and lasagna and gnocchi. (The al dente pastas -- spaghetti, linguini and so
					    forth -- are imported dry from Italy.) Rosa Borraccio makes the hearty sauce.</p>
					    <p>Lino and Vera Borraccio have built their business slowly over the last 11 years, with no advertising, one convert at a time. &quot;I think we have more repeat business than any other restaurant in town,&quot; says Lino Borraccio.</p>
					    <p>They pay great attention to small details. For example, with the inevitable leftovers, they won't drop a take-out box on your table. They'll take the food back to the kitchen
					    and bring it back wrapped tightly against dripping and nicely labeled with what's inside.</p>
					    <p>Lino's is an especially nice place to take a group. The staff handles big tables seamlessly. The longtime waitresses are more than competent; they seem to care. They want
					    you to have a good time. They want the birthday person in your party to feel special. They are as far from prima donna servers as you can get.</p>
					    <p>The menu is large, but no part seems treated as an afterthought. Some of the good things include:</p>
					    <p>Lasagna -- a treat if you've only had lasagna made with thick, ripple-edged pasta. Lino's thin, tender sheets are not stacked like floors of an office building but piled loosely into a rich dish of meat and cheese. There's also vegetarian lasagna.</p>
					    <p>Perch is a frequent special, sauteed in butter. The delicate little fillets come to the table moist but never greasy.</p>
					    <p>The penne puttanesca is a spicy pasta with tomatoes, capers, hot peppers and a lot of olives. And the gnocchi with Gorgonzola cheese sauce is memorable.</p>
					    <p>Side dishes can also be surprisingly good. Some favorites include: chicken and artichoke soup, rich and creamy with big chunks of chicken; the pine nut salad dressing, a light
					    vinaigrette with a slight bit of sweetness to complement the nuts; and the farmer's salad, a no-lettuce salad with chunky vegetables in the house dressing.</p>
					    <p>If there's any small complaint about the food, it's that once in a great while, the salt content seems a little over the top.</p>
					    <p>The tiramisu is especially fine. Vera Borraccio makes it fresh every day -- twice a day when there's a run -- along with the fresh cannoli. Her version is the classic, says Lino Borraccio. It's very moist and served in a stemmed glass. Between making desserts and supervising the pasta team, Vera Borraccio is also the cordial hostess.</p>
					    <p>&quot;She gets me in trouble,&quot; says her husband, &quot;because she always promises
					    certain tables to too many people.&quot;</p>

					<h2>Popular Lino's won't be leaving anytime soon</h2>
					<h3>
						<b>Rochester Eccentric Newspaper</b> 
						<br />Date: Thrusday Feb 5, 2004
					</h3>
					<div>
						<p>Lino Borraccio can't help but offer a guest a plate of pasta. He's been doing it for 23 years at his restaurant, Lino's, on Tienken just west of Rochester Road. God willing, nothing is going to change for the foreseeable future. The corner is slated to be redeveloped, and worried customers have been calling, wondering if he's moving, remodeling - or closing. Perish the thought. </p>
						<p>As Papa Joe's builds a new store behind him, Lino's will move its driveway and parking lot to accommodate a new shopping center. Other than that, nothing's going to change. "The only thing we're doing is we're getting more room for parking," he says.</p>
						<p>Consistency is what makes Lino's so popular. "Nothing special," Borraccio says modestly. "You know what you're going to get." On Friday and Saturday nights, regulars line up for just that. "We know about 75 to 80 percent of the people who come through the door," he says. "When people come in here on Friday night, it's like a wedding reception." They ask about the family, they order up the dishes that have been all day in the making, then savor them amidst wood paneling and white tablecloths. On cold winter nights, with a fireplace warming the dining room, they don't want to leave. "It's not a restaurant with old recipes; it's just a good restaurant," Borraccio says. </p>
						<p>Longtime customer Joseph Mark, a local plastic surgeon, says there's no reason to change a thing. 
						"I happen to like fresh, good, homemade cooking," he says, helping himself to an espresso. It's lunchtime and the restaurant isn't open, but Mark and Borraccio are by now old friends, comfortable finishing each other's sentences. "He's got the key," Borraccio jokes. Mark says Borraccio is always 
						looking to improve. "But what's wrong with where you're sitting?" he asks a first-time visitor. No argument there. Borraccio and his two brothers came to the United States from San Vittore, Italy in 1958. His wife is from the town of San D'Elie, eight miles away. Former medieval castles, the villages are near the monastery of Monte Cassino, the site of a World War II battle. Borraccio ran the Venetian Club in Macomb County for 20 years before opening Lino's. </p>
						<p>"I had to have my head examined," he says, remembering his decision to purchase the building, 
						which came complete with a drive-through window. "But we made something of it." Son Tony runs the kitchen, and the grandchildren are regular visitors. Father and son live in Oakland Township. Though the menu offers many pasta choices, Borraccio is also proud of his beef and says he's fussy with suppliers. </p>
						<p>"I found that getting compliments is better than getting complaints," he says. Lino's is open for dinner five nights a week. For reservations, call (248) 652-9002.</p>

				<h2>Lino's in Rochester Hills is polished to the core</h2>

					<p>Lino's in Rochester Hills may be the best kept dining secret in the northern metro-Detroit suburbs. An unpretentious exterior includes a sign announcing Pasta-Seafood-Steaks. Inside, diners are transported to a ristorante outside Rome, that's polished to the core. </p>
					<p>There's an expectation when an owner's name is on a restaurant. Owner Lino Borraccio delivers. He's at home in the environment he created. Booths and tables in warm wood tones with white table cloths and Burgundy napkins are accented by Italian tile floors and attractive wall art. </p>
					<p>The main dining room, well-separated from the bar, has sufficient divisions to act as sound barriers. Group conversation at dinner is possible. The warm glow of a fireplace creates a cozy mood.</p>
					<p>Lino's has become well known by word of mouth. And word of mouth sells quality. Lino's loyal clientele since 1988 includes top professionals and company CEOs.</p>
					<p>"Twenty years ago I saw the potential of this location," admits Lino who emigrated from a village outside Rome in 1958. "Back then it was terrible. Today, it's the best comeback since Lazarus." It was well worth the wait.</p>
					<p>"I stuck to my game plan. I do not serve pizza or ribs. My waiters are formally dressed. I waited for the area to develop and for clientele to recognize what I offer."</p>
					<p>In addition to an outstanding menu, Lino's ace is that he recognizes diners and their comfort level. How can he not? He's about the floor, greeting regular diners at their table and introducing himself to anyone he does not recognize. </p>
					<p>"Diners come here for the consistency in food quality and service," he insists. "If someone does not like the way their order was prepared, they should tell me. We'll make it right."</p>
					<p>Given the experience in Lino's kitchen, complaints are few and far between. Executive Chef Andy Toth worked 32 years at Joe Muer's in Detroit. For the last eight, he's been at Lino's. Chefs de Cuisine Jim and Steve Vincent add to the kitchen team concept.</p>
					<p>To get the full impact of menu offerings, start with Lino's Appetizer Platter for two or more people. It includes scallops, escargot, shrimp, calamari, olives and cheese. Antipasto Italiano, an assortment of prosciutto, salami, cheese and olives can hardly be dubbed a second choice.</p>
					<p>Twenty pasta entrees include three with housemade pasta: Baked Lasagna (meat or vegetable layers), Ravioli and Gnocchi alla Gorgonzola. Imported Dicecco pasta is used for other dishes. Risotto includes chicken and mushrooms. </p>
					<p>When offered as specials, don't hesitate, order Seafood Ravioli with lobster sauce or the Cioppino.</p>
					<p>Saut&eacute;ed Perch gets the diner's pick as most popular seafood entree. I recommend Shrimp Giardiniera, jumbo shrimp saut&eacute;ed in white wine tomato sauce with red and green peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms.</p>
					<p>Pollo Bolognese, baked boneless chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto and fontina cheese is numero uno among poultry entrees.</p>
					<p>Veal Giuliana, veal medallions saut&eacute;ed with red and green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes and vodka, tops the veal entrees. When offered as a special, don't miss the very Roman-style Saltimbocca.</p>
					<p>While Lino's chefs make all the mouth-watering main dishes, it's Lino's wife Elvira who makes the authentic Tiramisu for dessert. It's so popular, she makes it twice daily.</p>
					<p>Most Tiramisu served in Italian restaurants follows the Sicilian tradition and is made more like a cake. Using the influences of Rome, Elvira's Tiramisu, served in a tall wine glass, has a layer of lady fingers soaked in espresso and Frangelico, topped with fluffy egg whites and a sprinkling of cocoa. A light ending to cap off a great meal.</p>
